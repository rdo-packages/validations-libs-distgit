Hence rebasing after 1.7.1 bump.\n\nUnder ideal circumstances, the manual should be included in releases from wallaby to zed. Since VF follows independent branching model, these all take code from the same branch (master) and right now from the same tag. ",

Technically speaking the code is the same, it\u0027s just that now a part of it is being used to build man pages. \n\nAlthough there is a dependency change in the spec file, it\u0027s mostly about making existing state of affairs explicit.
